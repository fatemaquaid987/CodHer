# CodHer()
An interactive computer game to get young girls interested in technology made using Python and Pyglet.

## Inspiration
There are a lot of stereotypes that STEM careers are for men. Young women do not have a lot of easy access to technology education and women generally believe tech related fields would be too difficult for them. We decided to create a game that would be fun and rewarding allowing young women to learn a little bit about computer science and the technology fields.CodHer() is a game designed specifically for young girls. This is not a fully functional game but a protype designed by my team in 'She Innovates Hackathon 2019'.The aim of this game is to improve women participation in Tech industry by educating young girls about technology and encouraging them to consider technology as a possible career choice when they grow up. CodHer() won first prize in the hackathon. 

## Tools used
The game is built in Python using Pyglet, a python library. Most of the animated gifs were created in PIXEL. The mobile application prototype was designed using proto.io.  

## How to run the code
Install Python 3.5 and Pyglet.  
Run the Python application in your favorite IDE.  

## How to run the .exe
Inside the CodHer_prototype folder, click on the codHer.exe file to run the game.

##How to play
The user first may read some short tutorials on the concepts that will be presented in the game. If the user is already familiar with the concepts they may skip and go into game play. The game starts by choosing an avatar and then goes into the game play. The character is skateboarding through the city but begins running into obstacles such as firewalls or bugs. In order to jump over the obstacles, the player must correctly answer a question about coding or technology. If the user fails to answer the question they will lose a 'life'. After 3 'lives' are lost the user has lost the game and must go back to the homepage to try again. As the user continues to complete questions, they will level up and get questions that require increasing knowledge in computing.
